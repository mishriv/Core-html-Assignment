    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating and building websites and web applications that you see and
        use on the internet. It's like constructing a digital house for information, images, and functionality
        to be accessible to people all over the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>There are three main components of web development:</b>
        <br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Front-End Development:</b> This is like the "face" of the website that users interact with
            directly.
            Front-end developers use languages like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style
            Sheets),
            and JavaScript to create the layout, design, and interactivity of web pages. HTML is used for
            structuring content, CSS for making it look nice, and JavaScript for adding dynamic features like
            buttons, forms, and animations.
        </li>

        <li> <b>Back-End Development:</b> This part is like the "brain" of the website that works behind the
            scenes.
            Back-end developers build the server, databases, and application logic that allow websites to store
            and
            retrieve data, like user information, posts, or products. They often use languages like Python,
            Ruby,
            PHP, or JavaScript (Node.js) and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.</li>

        <li> <b>Full-Stack Development:</b> Some developers work on both the front-end and back-end, and they're
            called
            full-stack developers. They have a broader understanding of web development and can create entire
            web
            applications from start to finish.</li>
    </ol>

    <b>To start learning web development, you can follow these steps:</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</b> These are the fundamental languages for web development.
            HTML is for content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Many online tutorials and
            courses are available for beginners.</li>

        <li><b>Practice:</b> The more you practice, the better you'll become. Start with simple projects, like
            creating a personal webpage, and gradually work your way up to more complex tasks.
        </li>

        <li><b>Explore Frameworks:</b> As you get comfortable, explore popular frameworks or libraries that
            align with yourinterests, whether that's front-end with React, back-end with Node.js, or full-stack
        </li>

        <li><b>Build Real Projects:</b> Building real-world projects is the best way to learn. Create a personal
            blog, a portfolio website, or a simple web app that solves a problem you care about.</li>

        <li><b>Learn from Others:</b> Join web development communities, follow online forums, and learn from
            experienced developers. They can offer guidance, answer questions, and share valuable tips and
            tricks.</li>
    </ul>
